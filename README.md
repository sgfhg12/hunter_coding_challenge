## Coding Challenge
### Ildi's Pizzeria Deluxe 

#### NOTE
##### src/utils/pizzas.json is meant to mock a pizza database to fetch from
##### src/utils/pizzas.js is meant to act as an api as if it is calling the "database"
##### Because the api functions in pizzasApi.js is meant to act as an api, they are called in componentDidMount, as if they were asynchronous scalls rather than directly setting them in the constructor.

## `npm i` then `npm start` to run
